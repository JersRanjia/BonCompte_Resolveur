# BonCompte_Resolveur
This is an application made with Java (interface:JavaFX) to help user to find the solution of the game "Le compte est bon" for 6 inputs and one target.
The goal of the app was to practice the best first search algorithm. 
Unfortunately no commit was done before the first version was finalized.
